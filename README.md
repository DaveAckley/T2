# T2
Repository for support code for 'T2', the second generation indefinitely-scalable hardware tile.

Oct 23, 2018: At least, that's what it may become.  This repo was started in 2017 but T2 early development moved elsewhere. 
I'm hoping to repurpose this as a 'meta' repo to pull in all the pieces needed for a T2 tile, as those pieces come together.
