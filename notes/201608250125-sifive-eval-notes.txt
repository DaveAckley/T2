RISC-V custom silicon
TileLink cache coherence protocol?

Design risk: High
Potential performance: High
NRE Estimate: Not yet known..
Unit price: Not yet known

Five stage pipeline.
Pipelined multiplier with fixed two cycles latency
or iterative multiplier with configurable latency.
Three cycles on branch mispredict

The dev kit is $3500 at AVNET..  Hey, that's not even 18% of the
budget..
