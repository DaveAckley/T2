Ackley 'T2' second-generation tile project

---
GOAL: An indefinitely-scalable hardware tile capable of 10 AER or
better on the DReg benchmark, using a port of the existing MFM
codebase.

  Target board size: 3" x 3" x 0.75" or less.  

  Target price: $100/tile +-25%, given an order of 100-500 tiles.

---
PROPOSED APPROACH: Combine an off-the-shelf SoM with a carrier board
designed by this project.

The SoM will provide CPU, RAM, flash, and fine-grained power
management (e.g., 5V and down).  

The carrier board will provide intertile connectivity, coarse-grained
power management (e.g., 12V intertile switchable; 12V->5V intratile)
and tile I/O capabilities (reset button, RGB LEDs, users button or
accelerometer, USB micro-B connector, as budget allows).

Sample candidate SoMs could include:

DART-6UL

CL-SOM-iMX7 Dual core,
