Supply: 4.2 - 5V

PROS:

 - NINE FUCKING NINE TI-style 16C750 UARTs, 'up to 12 Mbps',
   presumably with DMA etc.

 - 1.5GHz

 - Compulab CL-SOM-AM57x exists

 - Dual core option

CONS:

 - 2.5â€“6.5W depending on config 2.5W/5V .. 6.5W/4.2V -> 500mA .. 1.5A

 - Compulab CL-SOM-AM57x is $100ea/1K with 512MB flash, $111ea/1K for
   dual core, which means $200 ea qty 10


JUDGMENT:

  Maybe..  It's definitely a possibility, but the tile price would
  likely be over $250, perhaps pushing $300, which is getting pretty
  embarrassing regardless of what story we try to tell..
